        This project is about making data for disabled students in Oregon more accessible and understandable. Brianna started working on it after talking to several principals of elementary schools about what her child's grade school experience would be like. She was disturbed by the lack of transparency and consistency in supports that disabled students receive in different areas, and set out to find the data that could help give a better sense of things. She started this site as a way to visualize and format that data into accessible tools for families, students, and advocates.
